## Why?

The metrics used in statistics (indices of fit, model performance, or parameter
estimates) can be very abstract. A long experience is required to intuitively
***feel*** the meaning of their values. In order to facilitate the understanding
of the results they are facing, many scientists use (often implicitly) some set
of **rules of thumb**. Some of these rules of thumb have been standardize and
validated and subsequently published as guidelines. Understandably then, such
rules of thumb are just suggestions and there is nothing universal about them.
The interpretation of **any** effect size measures is always going to be
relative to the discipline, the specific data, and the aims of the analyst. This
is important because what might be considered a small effect in psychology might
be large for some other field like public health.

One of the most famous interpretation grids was proposed by **Cohen (1988)** for
a series of widely used indices, such as the correlation **r** (*r* = .20,
small; *r* = .40, moderate and *r* = .60, large) or the **standardized difference** (*Cohen's d*). However, there is now a clear evidence that Cohen's
guidelines (which he himself later disavowed; Funder, 2019) are much too
stringent and not particularly meaningful taken out of context
[@funder2019evaluating]. This led to the emergence of a literature discussing
and creating new sets of rules of thumb.

Although **everybody** agrees on the fact that effect size interpretation in a
study should be justified with a rationale (and depend on the context, the
field, the literature, the hypothesis, etc.), these pre-baked rules can
nevertheless be useful to give a rough idea or frame of reference to understand
scientific results.

The package **`effectsize`** catalogs such sets of rules of thumb for a
variety of indices in a flexible and explicit fashion, helping you understand
and report your results in a scientific yet meaningful way. Again, readers
should keep in mind that these thresholds, as ubiquitous as they may be,
**remain arbitrary**. Thus, their use should be discussed on a case-by-case
basis depending on the field, hypotheses, prior results, and so on, to avoid
their crystallization, as for the infamous $p < .05$ criterion of hypothesis
testing.

Moreover, some authors suggest the counter-intuitive idea that *very large effects*, especially in the context of psychological research, is likely to be a
"gross overestimate that will rarely be found in a large sample or in a
replication" [@funder2019evaluating]. They suggest that smaller effect size are
worth taking seriously (as they can be potentially consequential), as well as
more believable.

## Correlation *r*

There can be used to interpret not only Pearson's correlation coefficient, but also Spearman's, $\phi$ (phi), Cramer's *V* and Tschuprow's *T*. Although Cohen's *w* and Pearson's *C* are _not_ a correlation coefficients, they are often also interpreted as such.

#### @funder2019evaluating

```r
interpret_r(x, rules = "funder2019")
```

- **r < 0.05** - Tiny

- **0.05 <= r < 0.1** - Very small

- **0.1 <= r < 0.2** - Small

- **0.2 <= r < 0.3** - Medium

- **0.3 <= r < 0.4** - Large

- **r >= 0.4** - Very large

#### @gignac2016effect

Gignac's rules of thumb are actually one of few interpretation grid justified
and based on actual data, in this case on the distribution of effect magnitudes
in the literature.

```r
interpret_r(x, rules = "gignac2016")
```

- **r < 0.1** - Very small

- **0.1 <= r < 0.2** - Small

- **0.2 <= r < 0.3** - Moderate

- **r >= 0.3** - Large

#### @cohen1988statistical

```r
interpret_r(x, rules = "cohen1988")
```

- **r < 0.1** - Very small

- **0.1 <= r < 0.3** - Small

- **0.3 <= r < 0.5** - Moderate

- **r >= 0.5** - Large

#### @evans1996straightforward

```r
interpret_r(x, rules = "evans1996")
```

- **r < 0.2** - Very weak

- **0.2 <= r < 0.4** - Weak

- **0.4 <= r < 0.6** - Moderate

- **0.6 <= r < 0.8** - Strong

- **r >= 0.8** - Very strong

#### @lovakov2021empirically

```r
interpret_r(x, rules = "lovakov2021")
```

- **r < 0.12** - Very small

- **0.12 <= r < 0.24** - Small

- **0.24 <= r < 0.41** - Moderate

- **r >= 0.41** - Large


## Standardized Difference *d* (Cohen's *d*)

The standardized difference can be obtained through the standardization of
linear model's parameters or data, in which they can be used as indices of
effect size.

#### @cohen1988statistical

```r
interpret_cohens_d(x, rules = "cohen1988")
```

- **d < 0.2** - Very small

- **0.2 <= d < 0.5** - Small

- **0.5 <= d < 0.8** - Medium

- **d >= 0.8** - Large

#### @sawilowsky2009new

```r
interpret_cohens_d(x, rules = "sawilowsky2009")
```

- **d < 0.1** - Tiny

- **0.1 <= d < 0.2** - Very small

- **0.2 <= d < 0.5** - Small

- **0.5 <= d < 0.8** - Medium

- **0.8 <= d < 1.2** - Large

- **1.2 <= d < 2** - Very large

- **d >= 2** - Huge

#### @gignac2016effect

Gignac's rules of thumb are actually one of few interpretation grid justified
and based on actual data, in this case on the distribution of effect magnitudes
in the literature. These is in fact the same grid used for *r*, based on the
conversion of *r* to *d*:

```r
interpret_cohens_d(x, rules = "gignac2016")
```

- **d < 0.2** - Very small

- **0.2 <= d < 0.41** - Small

- **0.41 <= d < 0.63** - Moderate

- **d >= 0.63** - Large

#### @lovakov2021empirically

```r
interpret_cohens_d(x, rules = "lovakov2021")
```

- **r < 0.15** - Very small

- **0.15 <= r < 0.36** - Small

- **0.36 <= r < 0.65** - Moderate

- **r >= 0.65** - Large


## Odds Ratio (OR)

Odds ratio, and *log* odds ratio, are often found in epidemiological studies.
However, they are also the parameters of ***logistic*** regressions, where they
can be used as indices of effect size. Note that the (log) odds ratio from
logistic regression coefficients are *unstandardized*, as they depend on the
scale of the predictor. In order to apply the following guidelines, make sure
you *standardize* your predictors!

Keep in mind that these apply to Odds *ratios*, so Odds ratio of 10 is as
extreme as a Odds ratio of 0.1 (1/10).

#### @chen2010big

```r
interpret_oddsratio(x, rules = "chen2010")
```

- **OR < 1.68** - Very small

- **1.68 <= OR < 3.47** - Small

- **3.47 <= OR < 6.71** - Medium

- **OR >= 6.71 ** - Large

#### @cohen1988statistical

```r
interpret_oddsratio(x, rules = "cohen1988")
```

- **OR < 1.44** - Very small

- **1.44 <= OR < 2.48** - Small

- **2.48 <= OR < 4.27** - Medium

- **OR >= 4.27 ** - Large

This converts (log) odds ratio to standardized difference *d* using the
following formula [@cohen1988statistical;@sanchez2003effect]:

$$
d = log(OR) \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\pi}
$$

## Omega / Eta / Epsilon Squared

The Omega squared is a measure of effect size used in ANOVAs. It is an estimate
of how much variance in the response variables are accounted for by the
explanatory variables. Omega squared is widely viewed as a lesser biased
alternative to eta-squared, especially when sample sizes are small.

#### @field2013discovering

```r
interpret_omega_squared(x, rules = "field2013")
```

- **ES < 0.01** - Very small

- **0.01 <= ES < 0.06** - Small

- **0.16 <= ES < 0.14** - Medium

- **ES >= 0.14 ** - Large

#### @cohen1992power

These are applicable to one-way ANOVAs, or to *partial* Eta / Omega / Epsilon
Squared in a multi-way ANOVA.

```r
interpret_omega_squared(x, rules = "cohen1992")
```

- **ES < 0.02** - Very small

- **0.02 <= ES < 0.13** - Small

- **0.13 <= ES < 0.26** - Medium

- **ES >= 0.26** - Large


##  Kendall's coefficient of concordance

The interpretation of Kendall's coefficient of concordance (*w*) is a measure of
effect size used in non-parametric ANOVAs (the Friedman rank sum test). It is an
estimate of agreement among multiple raters.

#### @landis1977measurement

```r
interpret_omega_squared(w, rules = "landis1977")
```

- **0.00 <= w < 0.20** - Slight agreement
- **0.20 <= w < 0.40** - Fair agreement
- **0.40 <= w < 0.60** - Moderate agreement
- **0.60 <= w < 0.80** - Substantial agreement
- **w >= 0.80**        - Almost perfect agreement

## Cohen's *g*

Cohen's *g* is a measure of effect size used for McNemar's test of agreement in
selection - when repeating a multiple chose selection, is the percent of matches
(first response is equal to the second response) different than 50%?

#### @cohen1988statistical

```r
interpret_cohens_g(x, rules = "cohen1988")
```

- **d < 0.05** - Very small

- **0.05 <= d < 0.15** - Small

- **0.15 <= d < 0.25** - Medium

- **d >= 0.25** - Large
