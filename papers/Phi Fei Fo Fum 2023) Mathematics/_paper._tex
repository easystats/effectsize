% If you would like to post an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use preprint as the journal and change 'submit' to 'accept'. The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

% Simple summary
\simplesumm{The \emph{\{effectsize\}} package from the \emph{easystats}
ecosystem makes it easy to estimate effect sizes in R for common
\(\chi^2\) tests, including a new effect size, Fei, for goodness-of-fit
tests.}

% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\)
\abstract{In both theoretical and applied research, it is often of
interest to assess the strength of an observed association. Existing
guidelines also frequently recommend going beyond null-hypothesis
significance testing and to report effect sizes and their confidence
intervals. As such, measures of effect sizes are increasingly reported,
valued, and understood. Beyond their value in shaping the interpretation
of the results from a given study, reporting effect sizes is critical
for meta-analyses, which rely on their aggregation. We here review the
most common effect sizes for analyses of categorical variables that use
the \(\chi^2\) (chi-square) statistic, and introduce a new effect
size---פ (Fei, pronounced /fej/ or ``fay''). We demonstrate the
implementation of these measures and their confidence intervals via the
\texttt{\{effectsize\}} package \citep{benshachar2020effectsize} in the
R programming language.}
