\arguments{
\item{x, y}{A numeric vector, or a character name of one in \code{data}.
Any missing values (\code{NA}s) are dropped from the resulting vector.
\code{x} can also be a formula (see \code{\link[stats:t.test]{stats::t.test()}}), in which case \code{y} is
ignored.}

\item{data}{An optional data frame containing the variables.}

\item{pooled_sd}{If \code{TRUE} (default), a \code{\link[=sd_pooled]{sd_pooled()}} is used (assuming equal
variance). Else the mean SD from both groups is used instead.}

\item{mu}{a number indicating the true value of the mean (or
    difference in means if you are performing a two sample test).}

\item{paired}{If \code{TRUE}, the values of \code{x} and \code{y} are considered as paired.
This produces an effect size that is equivalent to the one-sample effect
size on \code{x - y}.}

\item{ci}{Confidence Interval (CI) level}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis;
Controls the type of CI returned: \code{"two.sided"} (default, two-sided CI),
\code{"greater"} or \code{"less"} (one-sided CI). Partial matching is allowed (e.g.,
\code{"g"}, \code{"l"}, \code{"two"}...). See \emph{One-Sided CIs} in \link{effectsize_CIs}.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings and messages on or off.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods. When \code{x} is a formula,
these can be \code{subset} and \code{na.action}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the effect size ( \code{Cohens_d}, \code{Hedges_g},
\code{Glass_delta}) and their CIs (\code{CI_low} and \code{CI_high}).
}
\description{
Compute effect size indices for standardized differences: Cohen's \emph{d},
Hedges' \emph{g} and Glass’s \emph{delta} (\eqn{\Delta}). (This function returns the
\strong{population} estimate.) Pair with any reported \code{\link[stats:t.test]{stats::t.test()}}.
\cr\cr
Both Cohen's \emph{d} and Hedges' \emph{g} are the estimated the standardized
difference between the means of two populations. Hedges' \emph{g} provides a bias
correction (using the exact method) to Cohen's \emph{d} for small sample sizes.
For sample sizes > 20, the results for both statistics are roughly
equivalent. Glass’s \emph{delta} is appropriate when the standard deviations are
significantly different between the populations, as it uses only the \emph{second}
group's standard deviation.
}
\details{
Set \code{pooled_sd = FALSE} for effect sizes that are to accompany a Welch's
\emph{t}-test (Delacre et al, 2021).
}
\note{
The indices here give the population estimated standardized difference.
Some statistical packages give the sample estimate instead (without
applying Bessel's correction).
}
\section{Confidence (Compatibility) Intervals (CIs)}{
Unless stated otherwise, confidence (compatibility) intervals (CIs) are
estimated using the noncentrality parameter method (also called the "pivot
method"). This method finds the noncentrality parameter ("\emph{ncp}") of a
noncentral \emph{t}, \emph{F}, or \eqn{\chi^2} distribution that places the observed
\emph{t}, \emph{F}, or \eqn{\chi^2} test statistic at the desired probability point of
the distribution. For example, if the observed \emph{t} statistic is 2.0, with 50
degrees of freedom, for which cumulative noncentral \emph{t} distribution is \emph{t} =
2.0 the .025 quantile (answer: the noncentral \emph{t} distribution with \emph{ncp} =
.04)? After estimating these confidence bounds on the \emph{ncp}, they are
converted into the effect size metric to obtain a confidence interval for the
effect size (Steiger, 2004).
\cr\cr

}

\section{CIs and Significance Tests}{
"Confidence intervals on measures of effect size convey all the information
in a hypothesis test, and more." (Steiger, 2004). Confidence (compatibility)
intervals and p values are complementary summaries of parameter uncertainty
given the observed data. A dichotomous hypothesis test could be performed
with either a CI or a p value. The 100 (1 - \eqn{\alpha})\% confidence
interval contains all of the parameter values for which \emph{p} > \eqn{\alpha}
for the current data and model. For example, a 95\% confidence interval
contains all of the values for which p > .05.
\cr\cr
Note that a confidence interval including 0 \emph{does not} indicate that the null
(no effect) is true. Rather, it suggests that the observed data together with
the model and its assumptions combined do not provided clear evidence against
a parameter value of 0 (same as with any other value in the interval), with
the level of this evidence defined by the chosen \eqn{\alpha} level (Rafi &
Greenland, 2020; Schweder & Hjort, 2016; Xie & Singh, 2013). To infer no
effect, additional judgments about what parameter values are "close enough"
to 0 to be negligible are needed ("equivalence testing"; Bauer & Kiesser,
1996).
