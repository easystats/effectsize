\arguments{
\item{x, y}{A numeric vector, or a character name of one in \code{data}.
Any missing values (\code{NA}s) are dropped from the resulting vector.
\code{x} can also be a formula (see \code{\link[stats:t.test]{stats::t.test()}}), in which case \code{y} is
ignored.}

\item{data}{An optional data frame containing the variables.}

\item{mu}{a number indicating the true value of the mean (or
    difference in means if you are performing a two sample test).}

\item{ci}{Confidence Interval (CI) level}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis;
Controls the type of CI returned: \code{"two.sided"} (default, two-sided CI),
\code{"greater"} or \code{"less"} (one-sided CI). Partial matching is allowed (e.g.,
\code{"g"}, \code{"l"}, \code{"two"}...). See \emph{One-Sided CIs} in \link{effectsize_CIs}.}

\item{parametric}{Use parametric estimation (see \code{\link[=cohens_d]{cohens_d()}}) or
non-parametric estimation (see \code{\link[=rank_biserial]{rank_biserial()}}). See details.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings and messages on or off.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods. When \code{x} is a formula,
these can be \code{subset} and \code{na.action}.}

\item{iterations}{The number of bootstrap replicates for computing confidence
intervals. Only applies when \code{ci} is not \code{NULL} and \code{parametric = FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the common language effect sizes (and
optionally their CIs).

\description{
Cohen's \eqn{U_1}, \eqn{U_2}, and \eqn{U_3}, probability of superiority, and
proportion of overlap are CLESs. These are effect sizes that represent
differences between two (independent) distributions in probabilistic terms
(See details). Pair with any reported \code{\link[stats:t.test]{stats::t.test()}} or
\code{\link[stats:wilcox.test]{stats::wilcox.test()}}.
}
\details{
These measures of effect size present group differences in probabilistic
terms:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Probability of superiority} is the probability that, when sampling an
observation from each of the groups at random, that the observation from
the second group will be larger than the sample from the first group.
\item \strong{Cohen's \eqn{U_1}} is the proportion of the total of both distributions
that does not overlap.
\item \strong{Cohen's \eqn{U_2}} is the proportion of one of the groups that exceeds
\emph{the same proportion} in the other group.
\item \strong{Cohen's \eqn{U_3}} is the proportion of the larger second group that is
smaller than the median of the first group.
\item \strong{Overlap} (OVL) is the proportional overlap between the distributions.
(When \code{parametric = FALSE}, \code{\link[bayestestR:overlap]{bayestestR::overlap()}} is used.)
}

The parametric version of these effects assumes normality of both populations
and homoscedasticity. If those are not met, the non parametric versions
should be used.

Where \eqn{U_1}, \eqn{U_2}, and \emph{Overlap} are agnostic to the direction of
the difference between the groups, \eqn{U_1} and probability of superiority
are not.
}
\note{
If \code{mu} is not 0, the effect size represents the difference between the
first \emph{shifted sample} (by \code{mu}) and the second sample.
}
\section{Confidence Intervals (CIs)}{

For parametric CLES, the CIs are transformed CIs for Cohen's \emph{d} (see
\code{\link[=d_to_u3]{d_to_u3()}}). For non-parametric (\code{parametric = FALSE}) CLES, the CI of
\emph{Pr(superiority)} is a transformed CI of the rank-biserial correlation
(\code{\link[=rb_to_p_superiority]{rb_to_p_superiority()}}), while for all others, confidence intervals are
bootstrapped (requires the \code{boot} package).
}

\section{Confidence (Compatibility) Intervals (CIs)}{

Unless stated otherwise, confidence (compatibility) intervals (CIs) are
estimated using the noncentrality parameter method (also called the "pivot
method"). This method finds the noncentrality parameter ("\emph{ncp}") of a
noncentral \emph{t}, \emph{F}, or \eqn{\chi^2} distribution that places the observed
\emph{t}, \emph{F}, or \eqn{\chi^2} test statistic at the desired probability point of
the distribution. For example, if the observed \emph{t} statistic is 2.0, with 50
degrees of freedom, for which cumulative noncentral \emph{t} distribution is \emph{t} =
2.0 the .025 quantile (answer: the noncentral \emph{t} distribution with \emph{ncp} =
.04)? After estimating these confidence bounds on the \emph{ncp}, they are
converted into the effect size metric to obtain a confidence interval for the
effect size (Steiger, 2004).
